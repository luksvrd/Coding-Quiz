## Purpose
This website was created for users to quiz themselves on JavaScript concepts.

## Built Using
HTML, CSS, amd JavaScript

## Description
Ideally this website would have behaved with 3 phases, first being the quiz intro and start button, second the actual quiz content, and third the final score with a box to input the users initials. One one phase was to be shown at a time and the highscores link would take the user to a different page that displays all the highscores with the abilityto reset them.
