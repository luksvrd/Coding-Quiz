### \* [Description](#description)

This application is a timed quiz that will test you on coding concepts. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. It also features a clean and polished repository with a unique README.

```
User Story:
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

```

### \* [Installation](#installation)

This application assumes you have a 'complete dev environment' setup - a terminal, Node, & VS Code. To get started, Fork the repository and clone the new repo from your Github to your local computer. `cd` into the cloned repo and enter: `npm i`.

The following commands must be executed to run the application properly:
- `npm i` to install all dependencies
- `npm run build` to build the application
- `npx vite` to start the application

### \* [Usage](#usage)

Once you `cd` into the repo and started the server, you can begin editing any code and see how it looks on the front end. In order to see the changes you make, you will need to refresh the page.

To use the application, you simply need to click start & the quiz will begin. You will have 75 seconds to answer 5 questions. If you answer incorrectly, 10 seconds will be deducted from your time. Once you have completed the quiz, you will be prompted to enter your initials. Your score will be saved & you will be able to view your score on the high scores page.

### \* [Future Development](#Future-Development)

Ongoing goals in development include:

- Adding more questions to the quiz
- Adding animations to the quiz
- Adding a database to store high scores & user information

### \* [Questions](#questions)
